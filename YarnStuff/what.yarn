(y/n)\n\n<<if no or tutorial has>>\nOkay then, let's get started!\n\n<<if yes>>\nOkay, so, you're partying with your friends after a long time of no parties.\nYou have no money and the idea is to have the best time you can with your friends.\n<<sleep 4>>\nYou can perform actions by writing a verb and a noun. For example try \"talk to partner\".\n<<run the thingy, try to detect talk action and a subject, if it doesnt work, if it works it continues>>\n\nTalking with your friends is key to having a good time tonight. \n<<sleep 4>>\nYou can also use items you have in your pockets, they will affect how you feel. \nSome will give you a buzz, others will affect your breath and so on.\nTry \"smoke a cigarette\", \"smoke cig\" works too.\n<<run the thing, if detect is smoke and cigarette continue if not>> write \"smoke a cigarette\"\n\nWhen you perform actions, they take time, usually 10 minutes.\nThe party will END and the game will be OVER at 6:00 AM.\n<<sleep 6>>\n\nThere are three rooms in this party: the dance floor, the smoking room and the bathroom. \nYou can move between them. The actions in each room will change slightly.\nYou are currently in the smoking room, try moving to the dance floor. \n<<run the thingy, detect move and dance floor to continue>>\n\nLastly, while on the dance floor, you can try dancing. Just write \"dance\".\nDancing can lead to different outcomes.\n<<sleep 4>>\nLet's pretend you're having a great time, you've smoked some weed and the music's great. \n<<set some stuff>>\nTry writing \"dance\".\n<<input thingy, only accepts dance>>. \"try writing dance\"\n\nIf you don't like the music, are too sober or not enjoying the party it'll go worse.\n<<sleep 4>>\nLet's \"dance again\"\n<<set some shit>>\n<<do it again>>\n\nWhen you feel people are looking at you, it can make you self conscious.\nIt gives you performance anxiety.\n<<sleep 5>>\n\nIf your friends are on the dance floor with you, it'll help ease it.\nThe closer to your friends are, the less anxious you'll feel when they're by your side.\nSo remember to talk to your friends.\n<<sleep 4>>\nLet's try dance one last time.\n<<set some shit>>\n<<do it again>>\n\nCool. That's the end of the tutorial! Let's get to the game.\nreturn Beggining\n",
