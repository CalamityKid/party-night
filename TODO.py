#####REMEMBER.
# remeber to add people to player.people_in_party in Scenes when they are introduced
# add so many spaces everywhere. bad music only fucs you up on the dance floor. is smile in the bathroom after 2 for long enough?
# add music to dance. If on dance floor narrate music. Add time. Remove 30 minute refresh thing.
# Get the flow down properly in partner and the gather scenes, wtf is cool going up so much
# Turn off debug in formatting.format_input_command when compiling. LEAVE party. ok in select option.

# TO DO
# get rid of 30m update, dance only in dance floor
# consider making a save function.

# in dance
# the stats are all fucked up but I modified a lot of player stats so we gotta check that as well

# check if the Tanktop dance thing, flirt > 5 is ok or not, amarrar la scene partner tantop5

# body update or something is out of control
# theres a cool loop also, it cannot go down at all, its forever high, maybe bad dance should really get it down
