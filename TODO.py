#####REMEMBER.
# remeber to add people to player.people_in_party in Scenes when they are introduced
# add so many spaces everywhere. bad music only fucs you up on the dance floor.
# add music to dance. If on dance floor narrate music.
# Get the flow down properly in partner and the gather scenes, wtf is cool going up so much
# Turn off debug in formatting.format_input_command when compiling. LEAVE party. ok in select option.

# TO DO
# just deleted 30 m update, see if that checks out.
# consider making a save function.

# in dance
# gameoversmile "pusher friend met?" even though we hadnt i think
# add spaces to Cutie
# fix anxiety thingsss (in player probably)
# in narrate talk, chec if theres more than 4 people do it on separate lines
# gameover action narration "you get out of the club"?
# consider maing meeting cutie easier?
# the stats are all fucked up but I modified a lot of player stats so we gotta check that as well

# check if the Tanktop dance thing, flirt > 5 is ok or not, amarrar la scene partner tantop5

# body update or something is out of control
# theres a cool loop also, it cannot go down at all, its forever high, maybe bad dance should really get it down
