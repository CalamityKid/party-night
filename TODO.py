#####REMEMBER.
# remeber to add people to player.people_in_party in Scenes when they are introduced
# partner gives you "Borrow" memory
# Give "Tanktop Hookup" memory in flirt, the two of you hook up with them, also Tanktop Home and gameover

# TO DO
# Make an ask for action and put the asking items in there.
# # aslo Smile use G has too many spaces.
# write and program the flirt function and the calculations
# Write partner, pusher ("you get a comission") + gameover for each
# partner scene when you convince them to come down, times tlaked4, they go back for some reason
# smile doesnt offer G when in bathroom in times tlaked 1

# MAYBE
# Narrate everything before each turn, make text more interactive, maybe make it a setting.


# in dance
##if successful dance, trigger dance scenes for people in room, if possible
# really confirm that the outcome_on_stats works fine but it prob does
# consider making a formatting function that edits the length of sentences before theyre printed.
# the cool conjunction is weird
# the stats are all fucked up but I modified a lot of player stats so we gotta check that as well
