<<sleep 4>>>>
but then your partner's face lights up
and half smirking starts saying
    
    Remember that party in the warehouse?
    with the redhead in the crazy green jacket?

    Do you remember? (y/n)

if yes:
you totally remember, that was a crazy jacket

if no:
you don't remember at all but you nod anyway
<<sleep 2>>

    Yeah yeah! It's the same DJ.
    Jacket redhead was totally in control of the music that night.

you start to get the idea
you get your friends down to the dance floor
you get enough attention and the DJ will listen probably
it's a good plan. 

    Do you wanna try? (y/n)

if yes:
you say yeah, time to get your friends on the dance floor
add "Gathering" to player.memories
return True

 if no:
you say no, too much effort
add "Not Gathering" to player.memories
return True
